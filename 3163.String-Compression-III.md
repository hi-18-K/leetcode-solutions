# [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression-iii): String Compression III - MEDIUM

### Detailed explanation: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gukgrVzPFE)
## Intuition
for every index i in word count its subsequent character (not more than 9) which are same as character at index i.

## Approach


## Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) - where n is the size of word.

- Space complexity:
  O(n) - resultant comp string can be 2*n size in the worst case.

## Code
C++ : 
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    string compressedString(string word) {
        string comp = "";
        int n = word.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
            int j = i+1;
            while (j < (i+9) && word[j] == word[i]) {
                j ++;
            }
            comp.push_back('0' + j - i); comp.push_back(word[i]);
            i = j;
        }
        return comp;
    }
};
```
