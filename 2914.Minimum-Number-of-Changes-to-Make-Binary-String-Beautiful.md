### Detailed explanation: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uO2MtV8P-8)
## Intuition
We need to cut even length substring from given string s. We are not given any constraint on number of substrings or size of substrings cut. 
So it is easiest if we consider 2 length substrings to be cut from the input string s. Then we can compare the 2 characters in the substring and increase the count of operations if the characters are not same in 2 length substring.

## Approach
iterate the string s to consider every 2 length substring starting from index 0.
ie. if the string s has length 8, our substring indecies will be: 
substring 1 - [0,1], 
substring 2 - [2,3], 
substring 3 - [4,5], 
substring 4 - [6,7]

Now, compare the first and second character in every substring -
- If the characters are different, we will need to make one change - increase the count.

Return the count after iterating the complete string.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) - where n is the size of s.

- Space complexity:
  O(1) - constant space.

## Code
C++ : 
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int minChanges(string s) {
        int n = s.size(), cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
            if (s[i] != s[i-1]) cnt ++;
        }
        return cnt; 
    }
};
```
