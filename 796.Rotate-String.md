# [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/): Rotate String - EASY

# Solution 1: 
Accepted with current leetcode constraints and testcases. TLE on large test cases.

## Intuition
We need to check if the goal string can be achieved by performing any number of shift operations on the input string. In each shift operation, we remove the leftmost (first) character of string s and add it to to the rightmost (end) of the string.

This means relative position of characters does not change. 
In any shift operation, either absolute position of all the characters changes or none of the characters changes.

It is not possible to have some characters in the same place and some characters in swapped / changed places.


## Approach
From above intution, the problem boils down to finding if the goal string is same as a string s starting from any of the index of string s being the start position of goal.
There can be n possible distinct strings that can be achieved by performing swap on input string s (where n is the size of string s).
We can check if the string starting and a particular start index is same as goal in linear time.

hence, we can perform this check in O(n^2) complexity. 

Steps:
- Check if length of string s, and string goal are different
    - If yes, we cannot achieve goal from s by any number of swaps.
- We iterate through input string s, considering each of its index as the start index.
- for each start index -
    - check if characters of string s starting from start index, in a circular fashion **[i = (i +1)%(n)]** are same as characters of string goal starting from 0th index.
        - If yes, we can say that goal can be achieved from s - starting at current start index. Hence, return true.
        - If no, then skip matching futher characters of s and goal, and check for the next index of string s beign the start index.
- If we complete checking for all the index of string s being the start index, and can not find the goal string in it - return false.


## Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n^2) - where n is the size of string.

- Space complexity:
  O(1) - constant space.

## Code
C++ : 
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    bool rotateString(string s, string goal) {
        int n = s.size(), m = goal.size();
        if (n != m) return false;
        for (int start = 0; start < n; start ++) {
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int i = start; cnt < n; i = (i+1)%n, cnt ++) {
                if (s[i] != goal[cnt]) break;
            }
            if (cnt == n) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```


# Solution 2: Using KMP Algorithm
Optimal solution

## Intuition
The check for circular string in the above seems a bit complex. Instead if we create a doublestring such that: doublestring = s + s, the problem is just finding a pattern in a text. Which can be solved using KMP algorithm.

## Approach
Use KMP algorithm to find pattern goal in text doublestring.

Steps:
- Check if the size of string s and goal is same.
    - If yes, continue with further steps.
    - If no, return false.
- Check if the goal is found in doulestring using KMP algorithm.
    - If yes, return true.
    - If the goal is not found in doublestring return false.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) - where n is the size of string.

- Space complexity:
  O(n) - create a string doublestring of double size of string s.

## Code
C++ : 
```cpp []

class Solution {
private:
    vector<int> computelps(string pat) {
        int n = pat.size();
        vector<int> lps(n, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i ++) {
            int j = 0;
            while (pat[i] == pat[j]) {
                lps[i] = lps[i-1] +1;
                i++, j ++;
            }
        }
        return lps;
    }
    int kmp (string txt, string pat) {
        int n = txt.size(), m = pat.size();
        int it = 0, ip = 0;
        
        vector<int> lps = computelps(pat);

        while (it < n && ip < m) {
            if (txt[it] == pat[ip]) {
                it++, ip++;
                if (ip >= m) return (it - ip + 1);
            } 
            else if (lps[ip] > 0) {
                it = it - ip + lps[ip] + 1;
                ip = lps[ip];
            } else {
                it = it - ip + 1;
                ip = 0;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
public:
    bool rotateString(string s, string goal) {
        if (s.size() != goal.size()) return false;
        string doublestring = s +s;
        return kmp(doublestring, goal);
    }
};
