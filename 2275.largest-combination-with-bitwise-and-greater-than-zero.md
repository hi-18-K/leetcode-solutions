### Detailed explanation: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uO2MtV8P-8)
## Intuition
find how many candidate in candiddates array have a set bit at a given position in bit representation.

## Approach
Select every bit position as set bit possibility for answer > 0 one by one.
Iterate the array and count the maximum number of values that can be included for bit being set in current position.

Condition to check if a number  `num` has bit set in ith position: **num & (1 << i)**

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) - where n is the size of candidate array.

- Space complexity:
  O(1) - constant space.

## Code
C++ : 
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int largestCombination(vector<int>& candidates) {
        int n = candidates.size(), ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i ++){
            int cnt = 0;
            for(auto candidate : candidates){
                if(candidate & (1 << i))
                    cnt++;
            }
            ans = max(ans, cnt);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

```
